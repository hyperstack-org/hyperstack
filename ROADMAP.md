# Hyperstack 1.0

## Top-level project goals

+ One language for all code (which is Ruby for now)
+ Avoiding repetitive and boilerplate code.
+ Use convention over configuration where possible.
+ Class definitions that are internally consistent, and stable over time.
+ Class definitions that act like existing well known structures.
+ As friction free as possible configuration and development tool chain.
+ Good documentation, and a helpful community, both for users, and contributors.
+ A professional, well structured code base, complete test coverage, and automatic continuous integration.
+ Implementation should be as efficient both in speed and space as practical given the above.
