# Welcome

## Hyperstack

Hyperstack is a Ruby-based DSL and modern web toolkit for building spectacular, interactive web applications fast!

* **One language** throughout the client and server. All Ruby code is compiled by [Opal](https://opalrb.com/) into JavaScript automatically.
* Webpacker and Yarn tooling for a **modern, fast hot-reloader build environment with Ruby source maps**.
* A well documented and stable Ruby DSL for wrapping **React** and **ReactRouter** as well as **any** JavaScript library or component. No need to learn JavaScript!
* **Isomorphic Models with bi-directional data** so you can access your models as if they were on the client.

All that means you can write simple front-end code like this:

```ruby
class GoodBooksToRead < Hyperstack::Component
  render(UL) do
    Book.good_books.each do |book|
      LI { "Read #{book.name}" }.on(:click) { display book } if book.available?
    end
  end
end
```

In the code above, if the `good_books` scope changed \(even on the server\), the UI would update automatically. That's the magic of React and Isomorphic Models with bi-directional data at work!

## Website and documentation

* Website: [hyperstack.org](https://hyperstack.org)

Our website serves as a Hyperstack example application. All the doc content is loaded dynamically from this repo and converted to HTML on the fly. It uses React Semantic UI and a client-side JavaScript full-text search engine. Its a Rails app hosted on Heroku.

## Setup and installation

You can be up and running in **less than 5 minutes**. Just follow the simple setup guide for a new Rails application all correctly configured and ready to go with Hyperstack.

* Setup and Installation: https://docs.hyperstack.org/installation/man-installation

Beyond the installation we strongly suggest new developers work trough the [todo tutorial](https://docs.hyperstack.org/tutorial). As it gives a minimal understanding of the Hyperstack framework.

## Community and support

Hyperstack is supported by a friendly, helpful community, both for users, and contributors. We welcome new people, please reach out and say hello.

* Reach us at: [Slack chat](https://join.slack.com/t/hyperstack-org/shared_invite/enQtNTg4NTI5NzQyNTYyLWQ4YTZlMGU0OGIxMDQzZGIxMjNlOGY5MjRhOTdlMWUzZWYyMTMzYWJkNTZmZDRhMDEzODA0NWRkMDM4MjdmNDE)

## Roadmap

Hyperstack is evolving; we are improving it all the time. As much as we love Ruby today, we see ourselves embracing new languages in the future. [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/) perhaps? We are also watching [Wasm](https://webassembly.org/) carefully.

Please see the [ROADMAP](https://github.com/hyperstack-org/hyperstack/blob/edge/ROADMAP.md) for more information.

## Contributing

In general, if you would like to help in any way, please read the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/hyperstack-org/hyperstack/blob/edge/CONTRIBUTING.md) file for suggestions.  
System setup for the development of Hyperstack itself is documented in this file.

More specifically, we have a [Feature Matrix](https://github.com/hyperstack-org/hyperstack/blob/edge/docs/feature_matrix.md) that needs to be filled with missing features. The idea is that you can check here what the implementation status is of a Ruby \(on Rails\) feature. And if you have the time and skill you're more then encouraged to implement or fix one or two. But if you're not in a position to contribute code, just expanding and maintaining this table would be excellent.

## History

Hyperstack is an evolution of [Ruby-Hyperloop](https://github.com/ruby-hyperloop). We decided to rename the project to drop the Ruby suffix and also took the opportunity to simplify the repos and project overall.  
Hyperloop was started by the developers of the reactrb gem.
