# HTML and Component DSL

A key design goal of the DSL (Domain Specific Language) is to make it work seamlessly with the rest of Ruby and easy to work with HTML elements and Components. Additionally, the DSL provides an abstraction layer between your code and the underlying (fast moving) technology stack. Hyperstack always uses the very latest versions of React and React Router yet our DSL does not change often. We believe that a stable DSL abstraction is an advantage.

## HTML DSL

### HTML elements

A Hyperstack user-interface is composed of HTML elements, conditional logic and Components.

```ruby
UL do
  10.times { |n| LI { "Number #{n}" }}
end
```

> **Notice that the HTML elements (BUTTON, DIV, etc.) are in CAPS**. We know this is bending the standard Ruby style rules, but we think it reads better this way.

For example, to render a `<div>`:

```ruby
DIV(class: 'green-text') { "Let's gets started!" }
```

Would create the following HTML:

```html
<div class="green-text">Let's gets started!</div>
```

And to render a table:

```ruby
TABLE(class: 'ui celled table') do
  THEAD do
    TR do
      TH { 'One' }
      TH { 'Two' }
      TH { 'Three' }
    end
  end
  TBODY do
    TR do
      TD { 'A' }
      TD(class: 'negative') { 'B' }
      TD { 'C' }
    end
  end
end
```

The following HTML elements are available:

```html
A ABBR ADDRESS AREA ARTICLE ASIDE AUDIO B BASE BDI BDO BIG BLOCKQUOTE BODY BR BUTTON CANVAS CAPTION CITE CODE COL COLGROUP DATA DATALIST DD DEL DETAILS DFN DIALOG DIV DL DT EM EMBED FIELDSET FIGCAPTION FIGURE FOOTER FORM H1 H2 H3 H4 H5 H6 HEAD HEADER HR HTML I IFRAME IMG INPUT INS KBD KEYGEN LABEL LEGEND LI LINK MAIN MAP MARK MENU MENUITEM META METER NAV NOSCRIPT OBJECT OL OPTGROUP OPTION OUTPUT P PARAM PICTURE PRE PROGRESS Q RP RT RUBY S SAMP SCRIPT SECTION SELECT SMALL SOURCE SPAN STRONG STYLE SUB SUMMARY SUP TABLE TBODY TD TEXTAREA TFOOT TH THEAD TIME TITLE TR TRACK U UL VAR VIDEO WBR
```

And also the SVG elements:

```html
CIRCLE CLIPPATH DEFS ELLIPSE G LINE LINEARGRADIENT MASK PATH PATTERN POLYGON POLYLINE RADIALGRADIENT RECT STOP SVG TEXT TSPAN
```

### HTML parameters

You can pass any expected parameter to a HTML element:

```ruby
A(href: '/') { 'Click me' } # <a href="/">Click me</a>
IMG(src: '/logo.png')  # <img src="/logo.png">
```
Each key-value pair in the parameter block is passed down as an attribute to the tag as you would expect.

### CSS

You can specify the CSS `class` on any HTML element.

```ruby
P(class: 'bright') { }
... or
P(class: :bright) { }
... or
P(class: [:bright, :blue]) { } # class='bright blue'
```

For `style` you need to pass a hash:

```ruby
PARA(style: { display: item[:some_property] == "some state" ? :block : :none })
```

## Component DSL

Hyperstack Component DSL is a set of class and instance methods that are used to describe React components and render the user-interface.

The DSL has the following major areas:  

+ The `Hyperstack::Component` mixin or your own `HyperComponent` class
+ HTML DSL elements
+ Component Lifecycle Methods (`before_mount`, `render`, `after_mount`, `after_update`, `after_error`)
+ The `param` and `render` methods
+ Event handlers
+ Miscellaneous methods

## HyperComponent

Hyperstack Components classes include the `Hyperstack::Component` mixin or (for ease of use) are a subclass of a `HyperComponent` class which includes the mixin:

```ruby
class HyperComponent
  include Hyperstack::Component
end

class AnotherComponent < HyperComponent
end
```

At a minimum every component class must define a `render` method which returns **one single** child element. That child may in turn have an arbitrarily deep structure.

```ruby
class Component < HyperComponent
  render do
    DIV { } # render an empty div
  end
end
```

You may also include the top level element to be rendered:

```ruby
class Component < HyperComponent
  render(DIV, class: 'my-special-class') do
    # everything will be rendered in a div
  end
end
```

To render a component, you reference its class name in the DSL as a method call.  This creates a new instance, passes any parameters proceeds with the component lifecycle.  

```ruby
class FirstComponent < HyperComponent
  render do
    NextComponent() # ruby syntax requires either () or {} following the class name
  end
end
```

Note that you should never redefine the `new` or `initialize` methods, or call them directly.  The equivalent of `initialize` is the `before_mount` method.  

### Invoking Components

> Note: when invoking a component **you must have** a (possibly empty) parameter list or (possibly empty) block.

```ruby
MyCustomComponent()  # ok
MyCustomComponent {} # ok
MyCustomComponent    # <--- breaks
```

## Multiple Components

So far, we've looked at how to write a single component to display data. Next let's examine one of React's finest features: composability.

### Motivation: Separation of Concerns

By building modular components that reuse other components with well-defined interfaces, you get much of the same benefits that you get by using functions or classes. Specifically you can *separate the different concerns* of your app however you please simply by building new components. By building a custom component library for your application, you are expressing your UI in a way that best fits your domain.

### Composition Example

Let's create a simple Avatar component which shows a profile picture and username using the Facebook Graph API.

```ruby
class Avatar < HyperComponent
  param :user_name

  render(DIV) do
    # the user_name param has been converted to @UserName immutable instance variable
    ProfilePic(user_name: @UserName)
    ProfileLink(user_name: @UserName)
  end
end

class ProfilePic < HyperComponent
  param :user_name

  render do
    IMG(src: "https://graph.facebook.com/#{@UserName}/picture")
  end
end

class ProfileLink < HyperComponent
  param :user_name
  render do
    A(href: "https://www.facebook.com/#{@UserName}") do
      @UserName
    end
  end
end
```

### Ownership

In the above example, instances of `Avatar` *own* instances of `ProfilePic` and `ProfileLink`. In React, **an owner is the component that sets the `params` of other components**. More formally, if a component `X` is created in component `Y`'s `render` method, it is said that `X` is *owned by* `Y`. As discussed earlier, a component cannot mutate its `params` â€” they are always consistent with what its owner sets them to. This fundamental invariant leads to UIs that are guaranteed to be consistent.

It's important to draw a distinction between the owner-ownee relationship and the parent-child relationship. The owner-ownee relationship is specific to React, while the parent-child relationship is simply the one you know and love from the DOM. In the example above, `Avatar` owns the `div`, `ProfilePic` and `ProfileLink` instances, and `div` is the **parent** (but not owner) of the `ProfilePic` and `ProfileLink` instances.

### Children

When you create a React component instance, you can include additional React components or JavaScript expressions between the opening and closing tags like this:

```ruby
Parent { Child() }
```

`Parent` can iterate over its children by accessing its `children` method.

### Child Reconciliation

**Reconciliation is the process by which React updates the DOM with each new render pass.** In general, children are reconciled according to the order in which they are rendered. For example, suppose we have the following render method displaying a list of items.  On each pass the items will be completely re-rendered:

```ruby
param :items
render do
  # notice how the items param is accessed in CamelCase (to indicate that it is read-only)
  @Items.each do |item|
    PARA do
      item[:text]
    end
  end
end
```

What if the first time items was `[{text: "foo"}, {text: "bar"}]`, and the second time items was `[{text: "bar"}]`?
Intuitively, the paragraph `<p>foo</p>` was removed. Instead, React will reconcile the DOM by changing the text content of the first child and destroying the last child. React reconciles according to the *order* of the children.

### Dynamic Children

The situation gets more complicated when the children are shuffled around (as in search results) or if new components are added onto the front of the list (as in streams). In these cases where the identity and state of each child must be maintained across render passes, you can uniquely identify each child by assigning it a `key`:

```ruby
  param :results, type: [Hash] # each result is a hash of the form {id: ..., text: ....}
  render do
    OL do
      @Results.each do |result|
        LI(key: result[:id]) { result[:text] }
      end
    end
  end
```

When React reconciles the keyed children, it will ensure that any child with `key` will be reordered (instead of clobbered) or destroyed (instead of reused).

The `key` should *always* be supplied directly to the components in the array, not to the container HTML child of each component in the array:

```ruby
# WRONG!
class ListItemWrapper < HyperComponent
  param :data
  render do
    LI(key: @Data[:id]) { @Data[:text] }
  end
end  

class MyComponent < HyperComponent
  param :results
  render do
    UL do
      @Result.each do |result|
        ListItemWrapper data: result
      end
    end
  end
end
```

```ruby
# CORRECT
class ListItemWrapper < HyperComponent
  param :data
  render do
    LI { @Data[:text] }
  end
end

class MyComponent < HyperComponent
  param :results
  render do
    UL do
      @Result.each do |result|
        ListItemWrapper key: result[:id], data: result
      end
    end
  end
end
```

### The children method

Along with params components may be passed a block which is used to build the components children.

The instance method `children` returns an enumerable that is used to access the unrendered children of a component.

```ruby
class Indenter < HyperComponent
  render(DIV) do
    IndentEachLine(by: 100) do # see IndentEachLine below
      DIV {"Line 1"}
      DIV {"Line 2"}
      DIV {"Line 3"}
    end
  end
end

class IndentEachLine < HyperComponent
  param by: 20, type: Integer

  render(DIV) do
    children.each_with_index do |child, i|
      child.render(style: {"margin-left" => @By*i})
    end
  end
end
```

### Data Flow

In React, data flows from owner to owned component through the params as discussed above. This is effectively one-way data binding: owners bind their owned component's param to some value the owner has computed based on its `params` or `state`. Since this process happens recursively, data changes are automatically reflected everywhere they are used.

### Stores

Managing state between components is best done using Stores as many Components can access one store. This saves passing data btween Components. Please see the [Store documentation](/docs/dsl-client/hyper-store) for details.

### Reusable Components

When designing interfaces, break down the common design elements (buttons, form fields, layout components, etc.) into reusable components with well-defined interfaces. That way, the next time you need to build some UI, you can write much less code. This means faster development time, fewer bugs, and fewer bytes down the wire.

## Params

The `param` method gives *read-only* access to each of the scalar params passed to the Component. The params are accessed as instance variables converted to CamelCase.

Within a React Component the `param` method is used to define the parameter signature of the component.  You can think of params as
the values that would normally be sent to the instance's `initialize` method, but with the difference that a React Component gets new parameters when it is re-rendered.  

Note that the default value can be supplied either as the hash value of the symbol, or explicitly using the `:default_value` key.

Examples:

```ruby
param :foo # declares that we must be provided with a parameter foo when the component is instantiated or re-rerendered.
param :foo, alias: :something       # the alias name will be used for the param (instead of @Foo)
param :foo => "some default"        # declares that foo is optional, and if not present the value "some default" will be used.
param foo: "some default"           # same as above using ruby 1.9 JSON style syntax
param :foo, default: "some default" # same as above but uses explicit default key
param :foo, type: String            # foo is required and must be of type String
param :foo, type: [String]          # foo is required and must be an array of Strings
param foo: [], type: [String]       # foo must be an array of strings, and has a default value of the empty array.
```

#### Accessing param values

> Params are accessible in the Component class as instance variables in **CamelCase**. The CamelCase syntax is used to indicate that params are immutable.

For example:

```ruby
class Hello < HyperComponent
  # an immutable parameter, with a default of type String
  param visitor: "World", type: String

  render do
    "Hello #{@Visitor}" # notice how you CamelCase for immutable params
  end
end
```

### Immutable params

A core design concept taken from React is that data flows down to child Components via params and params (called props in React) are immutable.

In Hyperstack, there are **two exceptions** to this rule:

+ An instance of a **Store** (passed as a param) is mutable and changes to the state of the Store will cause a re-render
+ An instance of a **Model** (discussed in the Isomorphic section of these docs) will also case a re-render when changed

In the example below, clicking on the button will cause the Component to re-render (even though `book` is a `param`) because `book` is a Model. If `book` were not a Model (or Store) then the Component would not re-render.

```ruby
class Likes < HyperComponent
  param :book # book is an instance of the Book model

  render(DIV) do
    P { "#{@Book.likes.count} likes" }
    BUTTON { "Like" }.on(:click) { @Book.likes += 1}
  end
end
```

>Note: Non-scalar params (objects) which are mutable through their methods are not read only. Care should be taken here as changes made to these objects will **not** cause a re-render of the Component. Specifically, if you pass a non-scalar param into a Component, and modify the internal data of that param, Hyperstack will not be notified to re-render the Component (as it does not know about the internal structure of your object). To achieve a re-render in this circumstance you will need to ensure that the parts of your object which are mutable are declared as state in a higher-order parent Component so that data can flow down from the parent to the child as per the React pattern.

### Param Validation

As your app grows it's helpful to ensure that your components are used correctly. We do this by allowing you to specify the expected ruby class of your parameters. When an invalid value is provided for a param, a warning will be shown in the JavaScript console. Note that for performance reasons type checking is only done in development mode. Here is an example showing typical type specifications:

```ruby
class ManyParams < HyperComponent
  param :an_array,         type: [] # or type: Array
  param :a_string,         type: String
  param :array_of_strings, type: [String]
  param :a_hash,           type: Hash
  param :some_class,       type: SomeClass # works with any class
  param :a_string_or_nil,  type: String, allow_nil: true
end
```

Note that if the param can be nil, add `allow_nil: true` to the specification.

### Default Param Values

React lets you define default values for your `params`:

```ruby
class ManyParams < HyperComponent
  param :an_optional_param, default: "hello", type: String, allow_nil: true
```

If no value is provided for `:an_optional_param` it will be given the value `"hello"`

### Params of type Proc

A Ruby `Proc` can be passed to a component like any other object.  A param of type proc (i.e. `param :update, type: Proc`) gets special treatment that will directly call the proc when the param is accessed.

```ruby
param :all_done, type: Proc
...
  # typically in an event handler
params.all_done(data) # instead of params.all_done.call(data)
```

Proc params can be optional, using the `default: nil` and `allow_nil: true` options.  Invoking a nil proc param will do nothing.  This is handy for allowing optional callbacks.

```ruby
class Alarm < HyperComponent
  param :at, type: Time
  param :notify, type: Proc

  after_mount do
    @clock = every(1) do
      if Time.now > @At
        @Notify
        @clock.stop
      end
      force_update!
    end
  end

  render do
    "#{Time.now}"
  end
end
```

If for whatever reason you need to get the actual proc instead of calling it use `params.method(*symbol name of method*)`


### Components as Params

You can pass a Component as a `param` and then render it in the receiving Component. To create a Component without rendering it you use `.as_node`. This technique is used extensively in JavaScript libraries.

```ruby
# in the parent Component...
button = MyButton().as_node
ButtonBar(button: button)

class ButtonBar < HyperComponent
  param :button

  render do
    @Button.render
  end
end
```

`as_node` can be attached to a component or tag, and removes the element from the rendering buffer and returns it.   This is useful when you need store an element in some data structure, or passing to a native JS component.  When passing an element to another Hyperstack Component `.as_node` will be automatically applied so you normally don't need it.  

`render` can be applied to the objects returned by `as_node` and `children` to actually render the node.

```ruby
class Test < HyperComponent
  param :node

  render do
    DIV do
      children.each do |child|
        @Node.render
        child.render
      end
      @Node.render
    end
  end
end
```

### Other Params

A common type of React component is one that extends a basic HTML element in a simple way. Often you'll want to copy any HTML attributes passed to your component to the underlying HTML element.

To do this use the `collect_other_params_as` method which will gather all the params you did not declare into a hash. Then you can pass this hash on to the child component

```ruby
class CheckLink < HyperComponent
  collect_other_params_as :attributes
  render do
    # we just pass along any incoming attributes
    a(@Attributes) { 'âˆš '.span; children.each &:render }
  end
end
# CheckLink(href: "/checked.html")
```

Note: `collect_other_params_as` builds a hash, so you can merge other data in or even delete elements out as needed.

## State

In React (and Hyperstack) state is mutable. Changes (mutations) to state variables cause Components to re-render. Where state is passed into a child Component as a `param`, it will cause a re-rendering of that child Component. Change flows from a parent to a child - change does not flow upward and this is why params are not mutable.

State variables are normal instance variables or objects. When a state variable changes, we use the `mutate` method to get React's attention and cause a re-render. Like normal instance variables, state variables are created when they are first accessed, so there is no explicit declaration.  

The syntax of `mutate` is simple - its `mutate` and any other number of parameters and/or a block. Normal evaluation means the parameters are going to be evaluated first, and then `mutate` gets called.

+ `mutate @foo = 12, @bar[:zap] = 777` executes the two assignments first, then calls mutate
+ or you can say `mutate { @foo = 12; @bar[:zap] = 777 }` which is more explicit, and does the same thing

Here are some examples:

```ruby
class Counter < HyperComponent
  before_mount do
    @count = 0 # optional initialization
  end

  render(DIV) do
    # note how we mutate count
    BUTTON { "+" }.on(:click) { mutate @count += 1) }
    P { @count.to_s }
  end
end  
```

```ruby
class LikeButton < HyperComponent
  render(DIV) do
    BUTTON do
      "You #{@liked ? 'like' : 'haven\'t liked'} this. Click to toggle."
    end.on(:click) do
      mutate @liked = !@liked
    end
  end
end
```

### Components are Just State Machines

React thinks of UIs as simple state machines. By thinking of a UI as being in various states and rendering those states, it's easy to keep your UI consistent.

In React, you simply update a component's state, and then the new UI will be rendered on this new state. React takes care of updating the DOM for you in the most efficient way.

### What Components Should Have State?

Most of your components should simply take some params and render based on their value. However, sometimes you need to respond to user input, a server request or the passage of time. For this you use state.

**Try to keep as many of your components as possible stateless.** By doing this you'll isolate the state to its most logical place and minimize redundancy, making it easier to reason about your application.

A common pattern is to create several stateless components that just render data, and have a stateful component above them in the hierarchy that passes its state to its children via `param`s. The stateful component encapsulates all of the interaction logic, while the stateless components take care of rendering data in a declarative way.

State can be held in any object (not just a Component). For example:

```ruby
class TestIt
  def self.swap_state
    @@test = !@@test
  end

  def self.result
    @@test ? 'pass' : 'fail'
  end
end

class TestResults < HyperComponent
  render(DIV) do
    P { "Test is #{TestIt.result}" }
    BUTTON { 'Swap' }.on(:click) do
      mutate TestIt::swap_state
    end
  end
end
```

In the example above, the singleton class `TestIt` holds its own internal state which is changed through a `swap_state` class method. The `TestResults` Component has no knowledge of the internal workings of the `TestIt` class.

When the BUTTON is pressed, we call `mutate`, passing the object which is being mutated. The actual mutated value is not important, it is the fact that the *observed* object (our `TestIt` class) is being mutated that will cause a re-render of the *observing* `TestResults` Component. Think about `mutate` as a way of telling React that the Component needs to be re-rendered as the state has changed.

In the example above, we could also move the *observing* and *mutating* behaviour out of the Component completely and manage it in the `TestIt` class - in this case, we would call it a Store. Stores are covered in the Hyper-Store documentation later.

### What Should Go in State?

**State should contain data that a component's instance variables, event handlers, timers, or http requests may change and trigger a UI update.**

When building a stateful component, think about the minimal possible representation of its state, and only store those properties in `state`.  Add to your class methods to compute higher level values from your state variables.  Avoid adding redundant or computed values as state variables as these values must then be kept in sync whenever state changes.

### What Shouldn't Go in State?

State should contain the minimal amount of data needed to represent your UI's state. As such, it should not contain:

+ **Computed data:** Don't worry about precomputing values based on state â€” it's easier to ensure that your UI is consistent if you do all computation during rendering.  For example, if you have an array of list items in state and you want to render the count as a string, simply render `"#{@list_items.length} list items'` in your `render` method rather than storing the count as another state.

+ **Data that does not effect rendering:** Changing an instance variable (or any object) that does not affect rendering does not need to be mutated (i.e you do not need to call `mutate`).

The rule is simple: anytime you are updating a state variable use `mutate` and your UI will be re-rendered appropriately.

### State and user input

Often in a UI you gather input from a user and re-render the Component as they type. For example:

```ruby
class UsingState < HyperComponent

  render(DIV) do
    # the button method returns an HTML element
    # .on(:click) is an event handeler
    # notice how we use the mutate method to get
    # React's attention. This will cause a
    # re-render of the Component
    button.on(:click) { mutate(@show = !@show) }
    DIV do
      input
      output
      easter_egg
    end if @show
  end

  def button
    BUTTON(class: 'ui primary button') do
      @show ? 'Hide' : 'Show'
    end
  end

  def input
    DIV(class: 'ui input fluid block') do
      INPUT(type: :text).on(:change) do |evt|
        # we are updating the value per keypress
        # using mutate will cause a rerender
        mutate @input_value = evt.target.value
      end
    end
  end

  def output
    # rerender whenever input_value changes
	P { "#{@input_value}" }
  end

  def easter_egg
    H2 {'you found it!'} if @input_value == 'egg'
  end
end
```

### State and HTTP responses

Often your UI will re-render based on the response to a HTTP request to a remote service. Hyperstack does not need to understand the internals of the HTTP response JSON, but does need to *observe* the object holding that response so we call `mutate` when updating our response object in the block which executes when the HTTP.get promise resolves.

```ruby
class FaaS < HyperComponent
  render(DIV) do
    BUTTON { 'faastruby.io' }.on(:click) do
      faast_ruby
    end

    DIV(class: :block) do
      P { @hello_response['function_response'].to_s }
      P { "executed in #{@hello_response['execution_time']} ms" }
    end if @hello_response
  end

  def faast_ruby
    HTTP.get('https://api.faastruby.io/paulo/hello-world',
      data: {time: true}
    ) do |response|
      # this code executes when the promise resolves
      # notice that we call mutate when updating the state instance variable
      mutate @hello_response = response.json if response.ok?
    end
  end
end
```

### State and updating interval

One common use case is a component wanting to update itself on a time interval. It's easy to use the kernel method `every`, but it's important to cancel your interval when you don't need it anymore to save memory. Hyperstack provides Lifecycle Methods (covered in the next section) that let you know when a component is about to be created or destroyed. Let's create a simple mixin that uses these methods to provide a React friendly `every` function that will automatically get cleaned up when your component is destroyed.

```ruby
module ReactInterval

  def self.included(base)
    base.before_mount do
      @intervals = []
    end

    base.before_unmount do
      @intervals.each(&:stop)
    end
  end

  def every(seconds, &block)
    Kernel.every(seconds, &block).tap { |i| @intervals << i }
  end
end

class TickTock < HyperComponent
  include ReactInterval

  before_mount do
    @seconds = 0
  end

  after_mount do
    every(1) { mutate @seconds = @seconds + 1 }
  end

  render(DIV) do
    P { "Hyperstack has been running for #{@seconds} seconds" }
  end
end
```

Notice that TickTock effectively has two `before_mount` methods, one that is called to initialize the `@intervals` array and another to initialize `@seconds`

## Lifecycle Methods

A component may define lifecycle methods for each phase of the components lifecycle:

* `before_mount`
* `render`
* `after_mount`
* `before_receive_props`
* `before_update`
* `after_update`
* `before_unmount`

>Note: At a minimum, one `render` method must be defined and must return just one HTML element.

All the Component Lifecycle methods may take a block or the name of an instance method to be called.

```ruby
class MyComponent < HyperComponent
  before_mount do
    # initialize stuff here
  end

  render do
    # return just one HTML element
  end

  before_unmount :cleanup  # call the cleanup method before unmounting
  ...
end
```

Except for the render method, multiple lifecycle methods may be defined for each lifecycle phase, and will be executed in the order defined, and from most deeply nested subclass outwards.

### Lifecycle Methods

A component class may define lifecycle methods for specific points in a component's lifecycle.

### Rendering

The lifecycle revolves around rendering the component.  As the state or parameters of a component changes, its render method will be called to generate the new HTML.

```ruby
render do ....
end
```

The render method may optionally take the container component and params:

```ruby
render(DIV, class: 'my-class') do
  ...
end
```

which would be equivalent to:

```ruby
render do
  DIV(class: 'my-class') do
    ...
  end
end
```

The purpose of the render method is syntactic.  Many components consist of a static outer container with possibly some parameters, and most component's render method by necessity will be longer than the normal *10 line* ruby style guideline.  The render method solves both these problems by allowing the outer container to be specified as part of the method parameter (which reads very nicely) and because the render code is now specified as a block you avoid the 10 line limitation, while encouraging the rest of your methods to adhere to normal ruby style guides

### Before Mounting (first render)

```ruby
before_mount do ...
end
```

Invoked once when the component is first instantiated, immediately before the initial rendering occurs. This is where state variables should be initialized.

This is the only life cycle method that is called during `render_to_string` used in server side pre-rendering.

### After Mounting (first render)

```ruby
after_mount do ...
end
```

Invoked once, only on the client (not on the server), immediately after the initial rendering occurs. At this point in the lifecycle, you can access any refs to your children (e.g., to access the underlying DOM representation). The `after_mount` methods of children components are invoked before that of parent components.

If you want to integrate with other JavaScript frameworks, set timers using the `after` or `every` methods, or send AJAX requests, perform those operations in this method.  Attempting to perform such operations in before_mount will cause errors during prerendering because none of these operations are available in the server environment.


### Before Receiving New Params

```ruby
before_receive_props do |new_params_hash| ...
end
```
Invoked when a component is receiving *new* params (React.js props). This method is not called for the initial render.

Use this as an opportunity to react to a prop transition before `render` is called by updating any instance or state variables. The
new_props block parameter contains a hash of the new values.

```ruby
before_receive_props do |next_props|
  mutate @likes_increasing = (next_props[:like_count] > @LikeCount)
end
```

> Note:
> There is no analogous method `before_receive_state`. An incoming param may cause a state change, but the opposite is not true. If you need to perform operations in response to a state change, use `before_update`.

TODO: The above needs to be checked and a better example provided. PR very welcome.

### Controlling Updates

Normally Hyperstack will only update a component if some state variable or param has changed.  To override this behavior you can redefine the `should_component_update?` instance method.  For example, assume that we have a state called `funky` that for whatever reason, we
cannot update using the normal `state.funky!` update method.  So what we can do is override `should_component_update?` call `super`, and then double check if the `funky` has changed by doing an explicit comparison.

```ruby
class RerenderMore < HyperComponent
  def should_component_update?(new_params_hash, new_state_hash)
    super || new_state_hash[:funky] != state.funky
  end
end
```

Why would this happen?  Most likely there is integration between new Hyperstack Components and other data structures being maintained outside of Hyperstack, and so we have to do some explicit comparisons to detect the state change.

Note that `should_component_update?` is not called for the initial render or when `force_update!` is used.

> Note to react.js readers.  Essentially Hyperstack assumes components are "well behaved" in the sense that all state changes
> will be explicitly declared using the state update ("!") method when changing state.  This gives similar behavior to a
> "pure" component without the possible performance penalties.
> To achieve the standard react.js behavior add this line to your class `def should_component_update?; true; end`

### Before Updating (re-rendering)

```ruby
before_update do ...
end
```

Invoked immediately before rendering when new params or state are being received.  


### After Updating (re-rendering)

```ruby
after_update do ...
end
```

Invoked immediately after the component's updates are flushed to the DOM. This method is not called for the initial render.

Use this as an opportunity to operate on the DOM when the component has been updated.

### Unmounting

```ruby
before_unmount do ...
end
```

Invoked immediately before a component is unmounted from the DOM.

Perform any necessary cleanup in this method, such as invalidating timers or cleaning up any DOM elements that were created in the `after_mount` method.

### The force_update! method

`force_update!` is a component instance method that causes the component to re-rerender. This method is seldom (if ever) needed.

The `force_update!` instance method causes the component to re-render.  Usually this is not necessary as rendering will occur when state variables change, or new params are passed.  

## Event Handlers

Event Handlers are attached to tags and components using the `on` method.

```ruby
SELECT ... do
  ...
end.on(:change) do |e|
  mutate.mode(e.target.value.to_i)
end
```

The `on` method takes the event name symbol (note that `onClick` becomes `:click`) and the block is passed the React.js event object.

```ruby
BUTTON { 'Press me' }.on(:click) { do_something }
# you can add an event handler to any HTML element
H1(class: :cursor_hand) { 'Click me' }.on(:click) { do_something }
```

Event handlers can be chained like so

```ruby
INPUT ... do
  ...
  end.on(:key_up) do |e|
  ...
  end.on(:change) do |e|
  ...
end
```

### Event Handling and Synthetic Events

With React you attach event handlers to elements using the `on` method. React ensures that all events behave identically in IE8 and above by implementing a synthetic event system. That is, React knows how to bubble and capture events according to the spec, and the events passed to your event handler are guaranteed to be consistent with [the W3C spec](http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/), regardless of which browser you're using.

### Under the Hood: Event Delegation

React doesn't actually attach event handlers to the nodes themselves. When React starts up, it starts listening for all events at the top level using a single event listener. When a component is mounted or unmounted, the event handlers are simply added or removed from an internal mapping. When an event occurs, React knows how to dispatch it using this mapping. When there are no event handlers left in the mapping, React's event handlers are simple no-ops. To learn more about why this is fast, see [David Walsh's excellent blog post](http://davidwalsh.name/event-delegate).

### React::Event

Your event handlers will be passed instances of `React::Event`, a wrapper around react.js's `SyntheticEvent` which in turn is a cross browser wrapper around the browser's native event. It has the same interface as the browser's native event, including `stopPropagation()` and `preventDefault()`, except the events work identically across all browsers.

For example:

```ruby
class YouSaid < HyperComponent

  render(DIV) do
    INPUT(value: state.value).
    on(:key_down) do |e|
      alert "You said: #{state.value}" if e.key_code == 13
    end.
    on(:change) do |e|
      mutate.value e.target.value
    end
  end
end
```

If you find that you need the underlying browser event for some reason use the `native_event`.  

In the following responses shown as (native ...) indicate the value returned is a native object with an Opal wrapper.  In some cases there will be opal methods available (i.e. for native DOMNode values) and in other cases you will have to convert to the native value
with `.to_n` and then use javascript directly.

Every `React::Event` has the following methods:

```ruby
bubbles                -> Boolean
cancelable             -> Boolean
current_target         -> (native DOM node)
default_prevented      -> Boolean
event_phase            -> Integer
is_trusted             -> Boolean
native_event           -> (native Event)
prevent_default        -> Proc
is_default_prevented   -> Boolean
stop_propagation       -> Proc
is_propagation_stopped -> Boolean
target                 -> (native DOMEventTarget)
timestamp              -> Integer (use Time.at to convert to Time)
type                   -> String
```

### Event pooling

The underlying React `SyntheticEvent` is pooled. This means that the `SyntheticEvent` object will be reused and all properties will be nullified after the event method has been invoked. This is for performance reasons. As such, you cannot access the event in an asynchronous way.

### Supported Events

React normalizes events so that they have consistent properties across
different browsers.


### Clipboard Events

Event names:

```ruby
:copy, :cut, :paste
```

Available Methods:

```ruby
clipboard_data -> (native DOMDataTransfer)
```

### Composition Events (not tested)

Event names:

```ruby
:composition_end, :composition_start, :composition_update
```

Available Methods:

```ruby
data -> String
```

### Keyboard Events

Event names:

```ruby
:key_down, :key_press, :key_up
```

Available Methods:

```ruby
alt_key                 -> Boolean
char_code               -> Integer
ctrl_key                -> Boolean
get_modifier_state(key) -> Boolean (i.e. get_modifier_key(:Shift)
key                     -> String
key_code                -> Integer
locale                  -> String
location                -> Integer
meta_key                -> Boolean
repeat                  -> Boolean
shift_key               -> Boolean
which                   -> Integer
```


### Focus Events

Event names:

```ruby
:focus, :blur
```

Available Methods:

```ruby
related_target -> (Native DOMEventTarget)
```

## Javascript Components

Hyperstack gives you full access to the entire universe of JavaScript libraries and components directly within your Ruby code.

Everything you can do in JavaScript is simple to do in Ruby; this includes passing parameters between Ruby and JavaScript and even passing Ruby methods as JavaScript callbacks. See the JavaScript section for more information.

While it is quite possible to develop large applications purely in Hyperstack Components with a ruby back end like rails, you may eventually find you want to use some pre-existing React Javascript library.   Or you may be working with an existing React-JS application, and want to just start adding some Hyperstack Components.

Either way you are going to need to import Javascript components into the Hyperstack namespace. Hyperstack provides both manual and automatic mechanisms to do this depending on the level of control you need.

### Importing React Components

Let's say you have an existing React Component written in Javascript that you would like to access from Hyperstack.  

Here is a simple hello world component:

```javascript
window.SayHello = React.createClass({
  displayName: "SayHello",
  render: function render() {
    return React.createElement("div", null, "Hello ", this.props.name);
  }
})
```

Assuming that this component is loaded some place in your assets, you can then access this from Hyperstack by creating a wrapper Component:

```ruby
class SayHello < HyperComponent
  imports 'SayHello'
end

class MyBigApp < HyperComponent
  render(DIV) do
    # SayHello will now act like any other Hyperstack component
    SayHello name: 'Matz'
  end
end
```

The `imports` directive takes a string (or a symbol) and will simply evaluate it and check to make sure that the value looks like a React component, and then set the underlying native component to point to the imported component.

### Importing Javascript or React Libraries

Importing and using React libraries from inside Hyperstack is very simple and very powerful. Any JavaScript or React based library can be accessible in your Ruby code.

Using Webpacker (or Webpack) there are just a few simple steps:

+ Add the library source to your project using `yarn` or `npm`
+ Import the JavaScript objects you require
+ Package your bundle with `webpack`
+ Use the JavaScript or React component as if it were a Ruby class

Here is an example of setting up [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/):

Firstly, you install the library:

```
// with yarn
yarn add @material-ui/core

// or with npm
npm install @material-ui/core
```

Next you import the objects you plan to us (or you can import the whole library)

```ruby
# app/javascript/packs/hyperstack.js

# to import the whole library
import * as Mui from '@material-ui/core';
global.Mui = Mui;

# or if you just want one component from the library
import Button from '@material-ui/core/Button';
global.Button = Button;
```

The run webpack to build your bundle:

```
bin/webpack
```

Now you can use Material UI Components in your Ruby code:

```ruby
# if you imported the whole library
Mui.Button(variant: :contained, color: :primary) { "Click me" }.on(:click) do
  alert 'you clicked the button!'
end

# if you just imported the Button component
Button(variant: :contained, color: :primary) { "Click me" }.on(:click) do
  alert 'you clicked the button!'
end
```

Libraries used often with Hyperstack projects:

+ [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) Google's Material UI as React components
+ [Semantic UI](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) A React wrapper for the Semantic UI stylesheet
+ [ReactStrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/) Bootstrap 4 React wrapper

### Importing Image Assets via Webpack

If you store your images in app/javascript/images directory and want to display them in components, please add the following code to app/javascript/packs/application.js

```javascript
var webpackImagesMap = {};
var imagesContext = require.context('../images/', true, /\.(gif|jpg|png|svg)$/i);

function importAll (r) {
  r.keys().forEach(key => webpackImagesMap[key] = r(key));
}

importAll(imagesContext);

global.webpackImagesMap = webpackImagesMap;
```

The above code creates an images map and stores it in webpackImagesMap variable. It looks something like this

```javascript
{
     "./logo.png": "/packs/images/logo-3e11ad2e3d31a175aec7bb2f20a7e742.png",
     ...
}
```
Add the following helper

```ruby
# app/hyperstack/helpers/images_import.rb

module ImagesImport
  def img_src(filepath)
    img_map = Native(`webpackImagesMap`)
    img_map["./#{filepath}"]
  end
end
```

Include it into HyperComponent

```ruby
require 'helpers/images_import'
class HyperComponent
  ...
  include ImagesImport
end
```

After that you will be able to display the images in your components like this

```ruby
IMG(src: img_src('logo.png'))               # app/javascript/images/logo.png
IMG(src: img_src('landing/some_image.png')) # app/javascript/images/landing/some_image.png
```

### The dom_node method

Returns the HTML dom_node that this component instance is mounted to.  Typically used in the `after_mount` method to setup linkages to external libraries.

Example:

TODO - write example

### The `as_node` and `to_n` methods

Sometimes you need to create a Component without rendering it so you can pass it as a parameter of a method. This model is used often in the React world.

The example below is taken from Semantic UI, building a [Tab Component](https://react.semantic-ui.com/modules/tab/#types-basic) with multiple tabs:

Here is the Javascript example:

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { Tab } from 'semantic-ui-react'

const panes = [
  { menuItem: 'Tab 1', render: () => <Tab.Pane>Tab 1 Content</Tab.Pane> },
  { menuItem: 'Tab 2', render: () => <Tab.Pane>Tab 2 Content</Tab.Pane> },
]

const TabExampleBasic = () => <Tab panes={panes} />

export default TabExampleBasic
```

And here is the same example converted to Ruby:

```ruby
# notice we use .as_node to create the Component without rendering it
tab_1 = Sem.TabPane do
  P { 'Tab 1 Content' }
end.as_node

tab_2 = Sem.TabPane do
  P { 'Tab 2 Content' }
end.as_node

# notice how we use .to_n to convert the Ruby component to a native JS object
panes = [ {menuItem: 'Tab 1', render: -> { tab_1.to_n } },
          {menuItem: 'Tab 2', render: -> { tab_2.to_n } }
]

Sem.Tab(panes: panes.to_n )
```

### Including React Source  

If you are in the business of importing components with a tool like Webpack, then you will need to let Webpack (or whatever dependency manager you are using) take care of including the React source code.  Just make sure that you are *not* including it on the ruby side of things. Hyperstack is currently tested with React versions 13, 14, and 15, so its not sensitive to the version you use.

However it gets a little tricky if you are using the react-rails gem.  Each version of this gem depends on a specific version of React, and so you will need to manually declare this dependency in your Javascript dependency manager.  Consult this [table](https://github.com/reactjs/react-rails/blob/master/VERSIONS.md) to determine which version of React you need. For example assuming you are using `npm` to install modules and you are using version 1.7.2 of react-rails you would say something like this:

```bash
npm install react@15.0.2 react-dom@15.0.2 --save
```  


## Elements and Rendering

### React.create_element

**Note: You almost never need to directly call `create_element`, the DSL, Rails, and jQuery interfaces take care of this for you.**

A React Element is a component class, a set of parameters, and a group of children.  When an element is rendered the parameters and used to initialize a new instance of the component.

`React.create_element` creates a new element.  It takes either the component class, or a string (representing a built in tag such as div, or span), the parameters (properties) to be passed to the element, and optionally a block that will be evaluated to build the enclosed children elements

```ruby
React.create_element("div", prop1: "foo", prop2: 12) { para { "hello" }; para { "goodby" } )
  # when rendered will generates <div prop1="foo" prop2="12"><p>hello</p><p>goodby</p></div>
```

```ruby
# dsl - creates element and pushes it into the rendering buffer
MyComponent(...params...) { ...optional children... }

# dsl - component will NOT be placed in the rendering buffer
MyComponent(...params...) { ... }.as_node

# in a rails controller - renders component as the view
render_component("MyComponent", ...params...)

# in a rails view helper - renders component into the view (like a partial)
react_component("MyComponent", ...)

# from jQuery (Note Element is the Opal jQuery wrapper, not be confused with React::Element)
Element['#container'].render { MyComponent(...params...) { ...optional children... } }  
```

### React.is\_valid\_element?

```ruby
is_valid_element?(object)
```

Verifies `object` is a valid react element.  Note that `React::Element` wraps the React.js native class,
`React.is_valid_element?` returns true for both classes unlike `object.is_a? React::Element`

### React.render

```ruby
React.render(element, container) { puts "element rendered" }
```

Render an `element` into the DOM in the supplied `container` and return a [reference](/docs/more-about-refs.html) to the component.

The container can either be a DOM node or a jQuery selector (i.e. Element['#container']) in which case the first element is the container.

If the element was previously rendered into `container`, this will perform an update on it and only mutate the DOM as necessary to reflect the latest React component.

If the optional block is provided, it will be executed after the component is rendered or updated.

> Note:
>
> `React.render()` controls the contents of the container node you pass in. Any existing DOM elements inside are replaced when first called. Later calls use Reactâ€™s DOM diffing algorithm for efficient updates.
>
> `React.render()` does not modify the container node (only modifies the children of the container). In the future, it may be possible to insert a component to an existing DOM node without overwriting the existing children.


### React.unmount\_component\_at\_node

```ruby
React.unmount_component_at_node(container)
```

Remove a mounted React component from the DOM and clean up its event handlers and state. If no component was mounted in the container, calling this function does nothing. Returns `true` if a component was unmounted and `false` if there was no component to unmount.

### React.render\_to\_string

```ruby
React.render_to_string(element)
```

Render an element to its initial HTML. This is should only be used on the server for prerendering content. React will return a string containing the HTML. You can use this method to generate HTML on the server and send the markup down on the initial request for faster page loads and to allow search engines to crawl your pages for SEO purposes.

If you call `React.render` on a node that already has this server-rendered markup, React will preserve it and only attach event handlers, allowing you to have a very performant first-load experience.

If you are using rails, then the prerendering functions are automatically performed.  Otherwise you can use `render_to_string` to build your own prerendering system.


### React.render\_to\_static\_markup

```ruby
React.render_to_static_markup(element)
```

Similar to `render_to_string`, except this doesn't create extra DOM attributes such as `data-react-id`, that React uses internally. This is useful if you want to use React as a simple static page generator, as stripping away the extra attributes can save lots of bytes.

## Prerendering

Prerendering will render your page on the server before sending it to the client. There are some limitations as there is no browser context and no JQuery available. Prerendering is very useful for static sites with complex HTML pages (like this website).

**Prerendering is controllable at three levels:**

+ In the rails Hyperstack initializer you can say:

 ```ruby
 Hyperstack.configuration do |config|
   config.prerendering = :on # :off by default
 end
 ```

+ In a route you can override the config setting by setting a default for Hyperstack_prerendering:

```ruby
get '/some_page', to: 'Hyperstack#some_page', defaults: {Hyperstack_prerendering: :off} # or :on
```

This allows you to override the prerendering option for specific pages. For example the application may have prererendering off by default (via the config setting) but you can still turn it on for a specific page.

+ You can override the route, and config setting using the Hyperstack-prerendering query param:

```html
http://localhost:3000/my_hyper_app/some_page?Hyperstack-prerendering=off
```

This is useful for development and testing.

>Note: in the route you say Hyperstack_prererendering but in the query string its Hyperstack-prerendering (underscore vs. dash). This is because of rails security protection when using defaults.

## DSL Gotchas

There are few gotchas with the DSL you should be aware of:

React has implemented a browser-independent events and DOM system for performance and cross-browser compatibility reasons. We took the opportunity to clean up a few rough edges in browser DOM implementations.

* All DOM properties and attributes (including event handlers) should be snake_cased to be consistent with standard Ruby style. We intentionally break with the spec here since the spec is inconsistent. **However**, `data-*` and `aria-*` attributes [conform to the specs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes#data-*) and should be lower-cased only.
* The `style` attribute accepts a Hash with camelCased properties rather than a CSS string. This  is more efficient, and prevents XSS security holes.
* All event objects conform to the W3C spec, and all events (including submit) bubble correctly per the W3C spec. See [Event System](#event-handling-and-synthetic-events) for more details.
* The `onChange` event (`on(:change)`) behaves as you would expect it to: whenever a form field is changed this event is fired rather than inconsistently on blur. We intentionally break from existing browser behavior because `onChange` is a misnomer for its behavior and React relies on this event to react to user input in real time.
* Form input attributes such as `value` and `checked`, as well as `textarea`.

### HTML Entities

If you want to display an HTML entity within dynamic content, you will run into double escaping issues as React.js escapes all the strings you are displaying in order to prevent a wide range of XSS attacks by default.

```ruby
DIV {'First &middot; Second' }
  # Bad: It displays "First &middot; Second"
```

To workaround this you have to insert raw HTML.

```ruby
DIV(dangerously_set_inner_HTML: { __html: "First &middot; Second"})
```

### Custom HTML Attributes

If you pass properties to native HTML elements that do not exist in the HTML specification, React will not render them. If you want to use a custom attribute, you should prefix it with `data-`.

```ruby
DIV("data-custom-attribute" => "foo")
```

[Web Accessibility](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria) attributes starting with `aria-` will be rendered properly.

```ruby
DIV("aria-hidden" => true)
```

## Further Reading

### React

To master Hyperstack you do need a solid understanding of the underlying philosophy of React and its component based architecture. The 'Thinking in React' tutorial below is an excellent place to start. Most searches for help on Google will take you to examples written in JSX or ES6 JavaScript but you will learn over time to translate this to Hyperstack easily.

### Opal

Hyperstack uses Opal to generate JavaScript from Ruby code. It is well worth reading the Opal guides and the Opal JQuery docs.
