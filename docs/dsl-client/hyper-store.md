# Stores

**Work in progress - ALPHA (docs and code)**
**These docs are out of date**

Hyperstack **Stores** are implemented in the **HyperStore Gem**.

Stores are where the state of your Application lives. Anything but a completely static web page will have dynamic states that change because of user inputs, the passage of time, or other external events.

```ruby
class UserStore < Hyperstack::Store
  state :current, scope: :class, reader: true

  def self.set_current! user
    mutate.current user
  end
end

# to access the store
UserStore.set_current! user
UserStore.current_user
```

**Stores are Ruby classes that keep the dynamic parts of the state in special state variables**

+ `Hyperstack::Store::Mixin` can be mixed in to any class to turn it into a Flux Store.
+ You can also create Stores by subclassing `Hyperstack::Store`.
+ Stores are built out of *reactive state variables*.
+ Components that *read* a Store's state will **automatically** update when the state changes.
+ All of your **shared** reactive state should be Stores - *The Store is the Truth*!
+ Stores can *receive* **dispatches** from *Operations*

## Reading and Mutating States

A Store will have one or more *Reactive State Variables* or *State* for short.  States are read using the `state` method, and are changed using the `mutate` method.

`state.items` reads the current value of the state named `items`.  Hyperstack tracks all reads of state, and mutating those states will trigger a re-render of any Components depending on the current value.

`mutate.items` returns the current value of the state named `items`, but also tells Hyperstack that the value is changing, and that any Components depending on the current value will have to be re-rendered.

The one thing you must remember to do is use `mutate` if you intend to update the internal value of a state.  For example if the state contains a hash, and you are updating the Hash's internal value you would use `mutate` otherwise the change will go unrecorded.

#### Initializing States

To assign a new value to a state use the `mutate` method and pass a parameter to the state:

```ruby
mutate.items(Hash.new { |h, k| h[k] = 0 })
```

#### Reading States

To read the current value of a state use the `state` method:

```ruby
state.items # returns current value of items
```

Typically a store will have quite a few reader (aka getter) methods that hide the details of the state, allowing the Store's implementation to change, without effecting the interface.

#### Mutating States

Often states hold data structures like arrays, hashes, sets, or other Ruby classes, which may be *mutated*.  For example when you push a new value onto an array you will mutate it.  The *value* of the array does not change, but its *contents* does.  If you are accessing a state with the intent to change its content then use the `mutate` method:

```ruby
mutate.items[item] = value
```

### Instances and Classes

Stores are often singleton classes.  In an application there is one 'cart' for example.

However sometimes you will want to create a class where each instance is a Store.  This is straight forward because if a state is read or mutated in an instance method, then you will be referring to that instance's copy of the state.

```ruby
# Each UserStream provides a stream of unique user profiles.
# Each instance has a single HyperStore state variable called user
# user will contain a single hash representing the user profile.
class UserStream < Hyperstack::Store

  # get another user

  def get_another!
    mutate.user UserStream._select_random_user
  end

  # extract various attributes from the user hash

  def user_name
    state.user[:login]
  end

  def user_url
    state.user[:html_url]
  end

  def avatar
    state.user[:avatar_url]
  end

  def initialize
    get_another!
  end

  def self._select_random_user
    # _select_random_user provides a stream of unique user profiles.
    # It will either return a user profile hash, or a promise of one
    # to come.

    # The cache of users to choose from does not have to be an state
    # variable, so we use plain instance variables.
    return @users.delete_at(rand(@users.length)) unless @users.blank?
    # execute the GetMoreUsers Operation to grab another batch of users
    # if we are not already waiting on a promise
    @promise = GetMoreUsers.then do |response|
      @users = response.json
    end if @promise.nil? || @promise.resolved?
    # wait for the promise to resolve then try again
    @promise.then { _select_random_user }
  end
end

class GetMoreUsers < HyperOperation
  def execute
    HTTP.get("https://api.github.com/users?since=#{rand(500)}")
  end
end
```
Stores that have multiple instances will typically have instance methods that directly mutate the store.  We recommend you end these methods with an exclamation (!) to make it clear you are exposing a mutator.

### States and Promises

The above example is greatly simplified because if a promise is assigned to a state it will not mutate  *until the promise resolves*.  Combining this with instance Stores gives a powerful way to encapsulate system behavior.

### Explicitly Declaring States

States like instance variables are created when they are first referenced.

As a convenience you may also explicitly declare states.  This reduces code noise, and improves readability.

```ruby
class Cart < Hyperstack::Store
  state items: Hash.new { |h, k| h[k] = 0 }, scope: :class, reader: true
end
```

This *declares* the `items` state as a class state variable, will initialize it with the hash on `Hyperstack::Boot`, and provides a reader method.
That is 6 lines of code for the price of 1, plus now the intention of `items` is clearly defined.

The `state` declaration has the following flavors, depending on how the state is to be initialized:

```ruby
  state :items, ... other options ... # items will be initialized to nil
  state items: [1, 2, 3], ... other options ... # items will be initialized to the array [1, 2, 3]
  state :items, ... other options ... do
    ... compute initial value ...
    ... context will be either the class an ...
    ... instance depending on the scope ...
  end
```

Other options to the `state` declaration are:

+ `scope:` either `:class`, `:instance`, `:shared`.  Details below!
+ `reader:` either `true`, or a symbol used to declare a reader (getter) method.
+ `initializer:` either a Proc or a Symbol (indicating a method), to be used to initialize the state.

The value of the `scope` option determines where the state resides.

+ A class state has one instance per class and is directly accessible in class methods, and indirectly in instances using `self.class.state`.
+ An instance state has a different copy in each instance of the class, and is not accessible by class methods.
+ A shared state is like a class state, but is also directly accessible in instances.

The default value for `scope:` depends on where the state is declared:

```ruby
  state :items # declares an instance state variable, each instance gets its own state
  class << self
    state :items # declares a class instance state variable
  end
```

In the above example there is one class instance state named `items` and an additional state variable also called
items for each instance.

The `shared` option just makes it easier to access a class state from instances.

```ruby
class MyStore < Hyperstack::Store
  state :shared_state, scope: :shared
  state :class_state, scope: :class
  state :instance_state # scope: :instance is default here

  def instance_method
    # shared state makes class states easy to access
    state.shared_state
    # without shared state class_state is still accessible
    # with more typing
    self.class.class_state
    # each instance gets its own copy of instance states
    state.instance_state
    # attempt to access a declared state variable out of context
    # results in an error!
    state.class_state # exception!
  end

  def self.class_method
    # this is the same state as was referenced in instance_method
    state.shared_state
    # and so is this
    state.class_state
    # and this will raise an exception
    state.instance_state
  end
```

Class state variables are initialized by an implicit `Hyperstack::Application::Boot` receiver.  If an initial value is directly provided (not via a proc, method or block) then the value will be `dup`ed when the second and following Boot dispatches are received.  The proc, method or block initializers will run in the context of the class, and the state variable will be available.  For example:

```ruby
state :boot_counter, scope: :shared do
  (state.boot_counter || 0)+1
end

# more practically perhaps:

state :my_state, scope: :shared do
  state.my_state || [] # don't re-initialize me on reboots
end
```

Instance variables are initialized when instances of the Store are created.  Each initialization will `dup` the initial value unless supplied by a proc, method or block.

This initialization behavior will work in most cases but for more control simply leave off any initializer, and write your own.

**Note for class states there is a subtle difference between saying:**

```ruby
state my_state: nil, scope: :shared # or :class
# and
state :my_state, scope: :shared # or :class

```

In the first case `my_state` will be re-initialized to nil on every boot, in the second case it will not.

## Receiving Operation Dispatches

Stores can receive Operation dispatches using the receive method.

Here is a simple shopping cart Store that receives Add, Remove and Empty Operations:

```ruby
class Cart < Hyperstack::Store
  # First we will define the two Operations.
  # Because these are closely associated with the Cart
  # we will name space them inside the cart.
  class Add < HyperOperation
    param :item
    param :qty, type: Integer, min: 1
  end
  class Remove < HyperOperation
    param :item
    param :qty, type: Integer, nils: true, min: 1
  end
  class Empty < HyperOperation
  end

  # The cart's state is represented as a hash, items are the keys, qty is the value
  # initialize the hash by receiving the system Hyperstack::Application::Boot or Empty dispatches

  receives Hyperstack::Application::Boot, Empty do
    mutate.items(Hash.new { |h, k| h[k] = 0 })
  end

  # The stores getter (or reader) method

  def self.items
    state.items
  end

  def self.empty?
    state.items.empty?
  end

  receives Add do
    # notice we use mutate.items since we are modifying the hash
    mutate.items[params.item] += params.qty
  end

  receives Remove do
    mutate.items[params.item] -= params.qty
    # remove any items with zero qty from the cart
    mutate.items.delete(params.item) if state.items[params.item] < 1
  end
end
```

This example demonstrates the two ingredients of a Store:

+ Receiving Operation Dispatches and
+ Reading, and Mutating *states*.

These are explained in detail below.

The `receive` method takes an list of Operations, and either a symbol (indicating a class method to call), a proc, or a block.

When the dispatch is received the method, proc, or block will be run within the context of the Store's class (not an instance.)  In addition the `params` method from the Operation will be available to access the Operations parameters.

The *Flux* paradigm promotes only mutating state inside of receivers.

Hyperstack is less opinionated.  You may also add mutator methods to your class.  Our recommendation is that you append an exclamation (!) to methods that mutate state.

Note that it is reasonable to have several receivers for the same Operation.  This allows subclassing, mixins, and separation of concerns.

Note also that the Ruby scoping rules make it very reasonable to define the Operations to be received by a Store inside the Store's scope.  This does not change the semantics of either the Store or the Operation, but simply keeps the name space organized.
