# Installation

The simplest installation is to use a rails template. All of the Hyperstack config is done in one commit, so you can see exactly what happened. 

## Hyperstack Rails Template

This template will create a new Rails app with Webpacker and Hyperstack 1.0 ALPHA configured.

### Usage

+ `rails new MyApp -m https://rawgit.com/hyperstack-org/hyperstack/edge/install/rails-webpacker.rb`

### Start the Rails app

+ Navigate to `http://localhost:5000/`

### Pre-Requisites
