## Tutorials

Writing a tutorial is a fantastic way of learning and sharing the knowledge. Over the years many people have written great tutorials and we would like to share them here.

Not all of the tutorials listed here are current with the latest versions of Rails or Hyperstack, but that does not always matter as long as you know that what you are reading might be outdated, there is still great insight and value.

+ [HelloWorld Tutorial](https://github.com/fzingg/hyperloop-rails-helloworld)
by Frederic ZINGG - an overview of all the core Hyperloop modules. This tutorial is based on Hyperloop (pre Hyperstack) but many of the same concepts are relevant in Hyperstack.

+ [Heart Cards](https://github.com/barriehadfield/heart-cards) by Barrie Hadfield - a Rails application using Components and Models and Semantic UI React. The tutorial is incomplete but the readme is comprehensive and it does demonstrate the use of JavaScript components in Hyperstack code.

+ [Hyperloop and Devise](https://github.com/barriehadfield/hyperloop_devise_tutorial) by Barrie Hadfield - a Rails project showing how to integrate Hyperloop and Devise. This tutorial is based on Hyperloop, but is still relevant.

Care to write a tutorial and have it on this list? Please submit a PR against this page and we would love to include it.

## Blogs

Writing a blog is a fantsatic way to expand out community and express your thoughts. Please add anything you write (or you find and think is relevent to this project).

Some recent blogs:

+ [The Exact Same App in Hyperstack part I](https://medium.com/@mitch_23203/the-exact-same-app-in-hyperstack-7f281cef46ca) - A comparison between React and Hyperstack. Hyperstack is a full stack framework. And when we say full stack we mean it. With Hyperstack you build your entire app in Ruby, from HTML layout and event handlers all the way to the database models.

+ [The Exact Same App in Hyperstack part II — Hold on to your socks!)](https://medium.com/@mitch_23203/the-exact-same-app-in-hyperstack-part-ii-5b062074ec20) - Persistance and push notifications in two lines of code!
