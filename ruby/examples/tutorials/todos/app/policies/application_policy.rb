# Policies regulate access to your public models
# The following policy will open up full access (but only in development)
# The policy system is very flexible and powerful.  See the documentation
# for complete details.

  always_allow_connection
  # Send all attributes from all public models
  regulate_all_broadcasts { |policy| policy.send_all }
  # Allow all changes to public models
  allow_change(to: :all, on: [:create, :update, :destroy]) { true }
  # allow remote access to all scopes - i.e. you can count or get a list of ids
  # for any scope or relationship
