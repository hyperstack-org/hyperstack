  # Tricky business here. Hyperstack::Store will define boot
  # if it is not already defined.  It creates a minimal compatible
  # API that includes the run and on_dispatch methods.  This way
  # you can use the Boot interface without loading operations.

  # Here we define Boot, but in case it has already been defined
  # we make sure to run the inherited method, and define the
  # on_dispatch and run methods.   Finally we copy any receivers
  # that may have been defined on the existing Boot to the new class.
